Why did we write Dancer2::Plugin::Cart?
  - we didn't need a schema, we just needed something to manage the display of product, and collection of data at checkout
  - we have an existing schema and business logic that we simply wanted to hook in at the appropriate stage
  - we could have simply written a cart from scratch... but why not create something others can use
  - the farther we got into it, the more interesting it became
It was so easy to build a checkout
I started to envision an entire ecosystem of plugins that allowed you to pick and choos

1 Base Dancer App
2 Use Plugin
3 Add link to /products
  - no products, we need to add some. Let's use the products hook
4 Add a Product
  - a Dancer2 Book!
  - Let's place an order, that was quick!
5 Create the view files
  - use the script provided with the Plugin, currently creates Template Toolkit views
  - this allows us to start customizing the data that is stored and displayed from the session
6 Display the description we added in Step 4
  - edit all of the view files
7 Send an Email receipt
  - use the after_checkout hook
  - we are simply sending the receipt view template
  - note that currently the order is only in the session, we could also add a hook to email the order to the admin
8 Add a coupon input
  - by simply adding an input to the shipping form, it is now accessible from the hooks and part of the order in the session
9 Check if we have a valid coupon
  - use the validate_shipping_params hook
  - error is displayed on the shipping view
10 Clear default adjustments
  - default adjustmenst are added for discounts, shipping, and taxes
  - we could add our discount into the discounts, but we want to display the coupon description
  - use the adjustments hook
11 Add coupon discount to adjustments
  - use the adjustments hook - again! hooks are run in the order they are defined
  - simply push an adjustment!
  - let's take a look
12 Use Cart::Stripe Plugin
  - add stripe api_key, public_api_key, and currency to config
  - this plugin provides some new keywords we can use in our hooks
13 Use DefaultHooks
  - one of the default hooks brings plans in from Stripe
  - but our products hook is overwriting the products list
14 let's push our products instead
  - Now we have Stripe plans in our cart!
15 Add Stripe form to checkout view
  - now we can accept payments by cc!
